## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

  A conditional statement is a block of code that evaluates a variety of options for a program to prompt.

  Examples:
  
    - if number = 25
    - if number > 25
    - if number < 25

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

  An if-statement is used to evaluate different options so that the computer knows how to respond to the user.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

```
if blue = true
  puts "That's my favorite color too!"
end
```

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

  You add multiple conditions to an if-statement by adding elsif and else.

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

  example:

```
if number >= 25
  puts "That amount is enough"
elsif
  puts "You will need more then that"
else
  puts "please enter a numerical value!"
end
```

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

  We can use conditionals to make comparisons.

    - 10 == 10 ==> true
    - "blue" == "red" ==> false
